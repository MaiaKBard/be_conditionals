# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

When comparing to varibales that you want an output of boolean. 

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I think in the comparisons.rb file - last question about why the output was an integer and not true/false, I wish I would have tried harder to figure out the answer before involving my mentor. I did a good google seach that gave me the answer but at first glance I was confused and asked for help. I will think of this in the future and try to problem solve/take the time to understand better before I ask for help. 

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

I was very sastified to know I was able to do the spicy problem in the code_challenges first. When seeing the title spicy challenge I was alittle intimidated but then I read the problem and re-wrote it, I realized I could frigure it out. So, I took a chance and beleived in myself and tried that problem first before the other ones. To my suprise I completed it fairly fast even with makeing a mistake. 

When just learning the if statement I was alil confused but I am happy that I told myself I could do everything in this repo and I did!
